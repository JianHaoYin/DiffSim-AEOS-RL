# DiffSim-AEOS-RL
Reinforcement learning framework for Agile Earth Observation Satellites (AEOS) scheduling, built on top of Satsim-pytorch with full support for differentiable simulation. This repository provides a research-ready environment to train, evaluate, and benchmark RL schedulers under realistic orbital dynamics, attitude control, energy, and field-of-view constraints.
